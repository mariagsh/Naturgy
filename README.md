# Naturgy
Collaborative project with Naturgy, a multinational company in the energy sector.

The contractual project consists of a model that predicts the activity in the horizon of the current Strategic Plan (3-5 years) based on data on commercial activity rates, expected portfolio increases, churn rate, sales channel mix, unit costs per channel, etc.  

Perhaps the most interesting part of the project was the simulation of alternative future scenarios.  All the information about the predicted results is displayed visually in an integration with PowerBI, so that it is easily understandable by Naturgy's commercial department. However, due to confidentiality agreement, the data extracted from the company activity cannot be published. 

During the EDA, we realised that the most predictive variable was the pressure of competition: when they were launching new promotions, when they had a stronger presence on twitter... Naturgy's commercial activity was highly affected. Competition landscape was an unmodelled variable, so I decided to model it from the information they share on their website and social networks.
